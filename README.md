## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To not be afraid to use different breakpoints. It looks really cool when little things change at different points. I was also able to use grid-area in a different way.

### Continued development

Nothing specific to point out, I just need to keep pushing and keep practicing :)
